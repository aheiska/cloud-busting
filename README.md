Learn to manage infrastructure with Terraform.

Here you will find various demonstrations regarding how to create infrastructure in AWS, Azure and GCP. In the first phase we provide examples just for AWS.

Using these examples requires that you fork this repository since in later steps you are required to modify some configurations and commit e.g. the state file to your own repository.

After forking this repository you should read [installing terraform instructions](README-installing-terraform-and-cli.md).
