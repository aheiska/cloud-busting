# Webapp modules

This example consists of the following modules:

* network: A VPC within which the backend and database are to be run
* ecs: Resources for running the webapp container and providing a load balancer endpoint to the application
* rds: A PostgreSQL database module

Your next step is to open terminal in each of these directories and give the following commands (just as you did previously with the backend):

* terraform init
* terraform plan
* terraform apply
